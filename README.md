## üöÄ Overview

**RoadMap** is a Windows application designed to help users create, organise and manage personal learning paths on various topics. It provides a structured approach to setting goals, defining sections and tracking progress towards specific objectives. The application is suitable for both self-study and collaborative planning of learning paths.

## üîë Key Features

- **Progress tracking:** Track your progress on various tracks with an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface.


- **Collaborative planning:** Users can upload already created roadmaps by other people and start tracking their progress immediately.


- **Roadmap creation:** Users can create a new roadmap by specifying title, author, topics, topic descriptions and subtopics.


- **Edit existing roadmaps:** Edit your goals already after creating a roadmap.


- **Be always in time:** Set deadlines for your roadmaps to stay on track and achieve your goals within the specified timeframe. *Application will notify you of upcoming deadlines :)*
